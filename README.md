# Data Visualization

This repository was used for the Data Visualization course of the master's degree o computer science in the University of Genova. 
It is focused on using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with d3.js) to create interactive visualizations based on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/5m-trees-dataset/data?select=Durham_Final_2022-06-18.csv "5M trees dataset"), that consists on more 63 csv files with relevant information of more than 5 million observations of trees all around the United States.

I used Python and pandas to merge all the csv files and to preprocess/clean the dataset in order to get relevant information. That's why in the [datasets folder](datasets) we can see different files, adapted to the requirements of each visualization.
