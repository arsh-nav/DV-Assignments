# Data Visualization

This repository was used for the Data Visualization course of the master's degree of computer science in the University of Genova. 
It is focused on using HTML, CSS and JavaScript (with d3.js) to create interactive visualizations based on [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/5m-trees-dataset/data?select=Durham_Final_2022-06-18.csv "5M trees dataset"), that consists on 63 csv files with information of more than 5 million observations of trees all around the United States.

We used Python and pandas to merge all the csv files and to preprocess/clean the dataset in order to get relevant information. That's why in the [datasets folder](datasets) we can see different files, adapted to the requirements of each visualization.
